#This repository is created for giving Demo on Git & Git Hub

##Things I did for making the `repository and How to use it .`
+ Created empty repository  named `demo` in [Github](https://www.github.com/new)
+Copied the contents from the page titiled `create a new repository on the command` line and the lines are 
 
```echo "# git-and-github" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/PugazharasanC/git-and-github.git
git push -u origin main
```
+ I have created an empty folder in my file explorer and opened the folder in CMD. After Opened CMD, I just copy pasted and executed the lines one by one.

  +This First line echo `"# git-hub-demo" >> README.md ` created an README.md file with the content `"# git-hub-demo"`.
